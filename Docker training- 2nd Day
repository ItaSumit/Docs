Creating an image:
To create an image , start from base image (ubuntu, alpine...)

Build image command: docker build -t=itasumit/nginxalpha .
In above command: -t is tag name and . represent current directory

Multiple RUN is not recommended because it will create many layers. Use && operator to combine multiple RUN commands
Example:
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install nginx -y && \
    apt-get install htop
    
Image history: docker image history itasumit/nginxalpha

Replacing index.html file with our own content
------------------------------------------------

set WORKDIR and COPY commands in Dockerfile 

If you don't see new content of index.html , check config file at below path and look for index html path
nginx config path- /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and then cat default

Dockerfile with logs: 
---------------------------------------------
refer actual dockerfile in git for the image. for nginx add below two RUN command
 && ln -sf /dev/stdout /var/log/nginx/access.log \
 && ln -sf /dev/stderr /var/log/nginx/error.log


Problem:
Create Nginx and PHP 7.0 image
Allow port 81 to be mapped also run nginx at 81
Create a folder inside /var called downloads
Download the github repository of nginx into downloads
Create a folder with 3 files, copy the complete folder into root directory of nginx
