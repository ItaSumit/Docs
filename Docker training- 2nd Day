Creating an image:
To create an image , start from base image (ubuntu, alpine...)

Build image command: docker build -t=itasumit/nginxalpha .
In above command: -t is tag name and . represent current directory

Multiple RUN is not recommended because it will create many layers. Use && operator to combine multiple RUN commands
Example:
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install nginx -y && \
    apt-get install htop
    
Image history: docker image history itasumit/nginxalpha
