Task1:

Install a Drupal Image along with postgres and configure it.

While configuring drupal with wizard, use postgres host as given service name in docker-compose file
No need to expose port fro postgres service because drupal and postgres are in same network

Swarm:
Refer google images , Raft consensus group, Internal distributed state store, Manager, Worker, Gossip network

docker swarm init
Error response from daemon: 
could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces
(10.0.2.15 on eth0 and 192.168.99.100 on eth1) - specify one with --advertise-addr

docker swarm init --advertise-addr {ethernet adapter ip, Ethernet adapter Ethernet:}

read the output of above command carefully. It will give token to join other system as Worker

Join other system as manager:

docker swarm join-token manager

read the output of above command carefully. It will give token to join other system as Manager

Docker ubuntu user set up:

sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
